# Surfing in csgo with Machine Learning
![alt text](https://github.com/LaihoE/Csgo-surf-ML/blob/main/surfexpl.png?raw=TRUE)  
Uses 3 catboost models to predict where to move mouse and what keys to press.  
Currently looking into RL solutions and deep learning models. Works surprisingly well without deep learning!
